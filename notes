When thinking about knitting from a computational perspective we need
more precise terms than are normally used. To this end I will use the
following definitions.



Think of all stitches as mappings from some number of loops on the
previous row (the parents) to some number of loops (the children) on
the next. 
This could accomedate reordering stitches (cabling) and increasing /
decreasing.
In the latter cases there will be an offset i.e. increase 1 to 2
slanting right would be +1 as all the stitches to the right will be
offset 1. If it were left slanting it would be -1



loop:
A loop of yarn around a needle which, in the normal course of things,
we would expect to knit through.

conserving stitch:
Any loop conserving action. i.e. any action where one loop in the
previous row is knitted through to create one stitch in the next
row. Note that stitch order does not have to be conserved.

decreasing stitch:
Any atomic action which reduces the number of stitches. i.e. where
more than one stitch in a row are knitted through to create one loop
on the next row.

increasing stitch:
Any atomic action which increases the number of loops.

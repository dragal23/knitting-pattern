Write more complete test cases!

Add definitions for standard stitches

Move cable_from_to to pattern.h++

Change cable_from_to so the either:
a) It does not assume rows are adjacens and interpollates liniarly
b) It checks that rows are adjacent


At the moment the simple view breakes if:
   1) The abbreviations are of varying length
   2) A stitch uses more than one 'simple' stitch
      I will call such stitches 'complex stitches'
See Notes for thoughts on this!

Extend stitches to allow more information to be stored: eg left
slanting, decrease, imcrease. (stiches such as cabling which naturally
chain together should also be flaggable. eventially this may allow
more powerfull gerneration algorythms!)

Implement a way to allow automatic conversion of rows to represent the
actions needed when knitting on the 'wrong' side!

Improve display routines to repeat sub sections where
apropriate. e.g. (k,p)(5) instead of k,p,n,p,n,p

Improve simple dispay routine to split rows sensibly when decreased / increased!

This is a simple set of classes to faclitate writing c++ programs to
generate knitting patterns.

In particular it handles storing and displaying the patterns.

At the moment it is rather basic and not overly functional.


patterns are comprised of rows. These in turn comprise of stitches. A
stich is a name and an abreviation. Rows in the pattern can be of any
size.

generators contains proof of concept code. This will be developed
concurrently with the library itself as flaws and useful features will
be fed back into the developement of the library itself!


Developement TODO:

Write more complete test cases!




Features TODO:

At the moment the simple view breakes if:
   1) The abbreviations are of varying length
   2) A stitch uses more than one 'simple' stitch
      I will call such stitches 'complex stitches'
See Notes for thoughts on this!

Extend stitches to allow more information to be stored: eg left
slanting, decrease, imcrease. (stiches such as cabling which naturally
chain together should also be flaggable. eventially this may allow
more powerfull gerneration algorythms!)

Implement a way to allow automatic conversion of rows to represent the
actions needed when knitting on the 'wrong' side!

Improve display routines to repeat sub sections where
apropriate. e.g. (k,p)(5) instead of k,p,n,p,n,p

Improve simple dispay routine to split rows sensibly when decreased / increased!

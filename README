This is a simple set of classes to faclitate writing c++ programs to
generate knitting patterns.

In particular it handles storing and displaying the patterns.

At the moment it is rather basic and not overly functional.


patterns are comprised of rows. These in turn comprise of stitches. A
stich is a name and an abreviation. Rows in the pattern can be of any
size.

generators contains proof of concept code. This will be developed
concurrently with the library itself as flaws and useful features will
be fed back into the developement of the library itself!


IMPORTANT:
The program modulation depends on libpsk, which is found in my
modulation repository (git@github.com:dragal23/modulation.git). The
easiest way to compile this is to get and compile the modulations repo
and install it. Edit the Makefile to specify your desired include and
lib locations.
